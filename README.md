RoadReady is an educational driving simulator designed to help teenagers safely practice real-world routes before getting behind the wheel. It combines Google Earth imagery, OpenStreetMap data, and custom-coded traffic law logic to create a realistic and immersive training environment. As our senior design project, RoadReady was a resounding success, meeting all core objectives and exceeding expectations.
